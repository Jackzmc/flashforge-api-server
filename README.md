# Flashforge API

An unofficial HTTP API server for Flashforge 3D Printers, allowing REST operations to get information and configure printers programatically.

Based on [01F0/flashforge-finder-api](https://github.com/01F0/flashforge-finder-api), but written in rust.
I didn't like using flask for a "production server" and wanted to add some features.

Built with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/), defaulted to running on `localhost:8080`

# Features

* Notifications on job completion (to email, or webhook such as Discord)
  * Including image of result
* APIs
  * Get info, status, temperature, head position, progress
  * Get camera stream, snapshot
  * Set temperature
* Camera Proxy
  * Allows multiple clients to view stream at once


## Tested Printers
Should work in theory on all the supported printers of flashforge-finder-api
* Flashforge Adventurer 5M Pro - Firmware v2.7.9

## API Doc

The `docs` folder includes documentation for use in [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/), set the `PRINTER` environment variable to that of your printers's id.

* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers`
  * Returns list of printer names
* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/info` 
  * Get printer info
* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/status` 
  * Get printer status
* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/temperatures`
  * Get sensor temperatures, B for bed, T0 for main sensor
* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/head-position`
  * Get the printer's head position
* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/progress`
  * Get print progress
* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/snapshot`
  * Get a single frame of printer's camera
* `GET http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/camera`
  * See printer's camera live, supporting multiple clients viewing at once
* `POST http://localhost:8080/apis/printers/:printerId/set-temperature/:tempIndex/:tempinC` 
  * Sets the temperature(Â°C) for the tempIndex (0 is usually hot end, 1 is the bed)

## Getting Started

1. Build the project with `cargo build --release` or find a release
2. Copy `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and configure it
    * All sections except [printers] are optional
3. Run target/release/flashforge-api or the binary file
    * The current directory must include the `config.toml` file

# Future Work

* [x] Notifications (email, push?, webhooks?) on completion
  * [x] Email
  * [x] Webhooks
  * [ ] Push?
  * [ ] Progress notifications
    * interval (every hour) or % based
  * [x] Image snapshots in notifications
* [ ] Simple UI that replaces need of polar3d
* [x] Write APIs
  * [x] Set temperature
  * [ ] Start / stop / pause file
  * [ ] Move head, bed
